Clone the code 

or 

3. Save the Code
Copy the code into a file named GasMixtureApp.py.


4. Run the Software
In the terminal or command prompt, navigate to the directory where GasMixtureApp.py is saved, then run: python GasMixtureApp.py

5. Using the Application
Once the application launches, you can follow these steps to calculate gas mixture properties:

Select Gas Components: Use the dropdown menu to select gas components and add them to the mixture.
Input Ratios: In the table, enter the molar ratios for each component. Ratios should be between 0 and 1.
Set Conditions: Enter the temperature (in Kelvin) and pressure (in Pascals) for the gas mixture.
Calculate Properties: Click the “Calculate Properties” button to estimate properties like Molar Volume, Compressibility Factor, and Density.
